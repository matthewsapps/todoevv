Only Boston's Fenway Park (1912) and Chicago's Wrigley Field (1914) are older than Evansville's Bosse Field. It is the site for the filming of \"A League of Their Own\" in 1992.  Whether you're a sports fan or a history buff, this 100-year-old stadium for America's favorite pastime is a must see! "
